# Frontend Features

## Gamepad

Main screen where you can find the most popular/featured games

## Stack Page (Name pending)

Place where curious developers can go and get an in depth look at the technology used to create gamebit, some examples:

- The language each game was written in
- The frontend framework
- The hosting framework (K8s)
- The manner in which we architect/scale our games/APIs
- Maybe some fun facts about each game too
  - Source code lines
  - Size of game in MBs
  - Author? Assuming others start joining? Or maybe call it "Lead Developer" and have a link to their profile

## My Profile

- Show Experience
- Show tokens
- Show language rankings (languages favored in games)
- Favorite games

## Tokens

Similar to milestones or trophies. The main "reward system" found in gamebit

## Experience

Will earn experience with each token.
Will most likely earn it through other means
By submitting bugs

- Could be cool to include a description for the developer who submitted it on how we fixed it
