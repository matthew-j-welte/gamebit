# Game 1

A simple 2D bidirectional game (with jumping), but at points in the game code will appear and you have X seconds to fix the bug in the code

__Ways of displaying this__:
  - What if this only happens when the user makes it to the end of a "stage" and proceeds to jump off a ledge and free fall to the stage below.
  - The user has until the avatar reaches the line of code with the bug in it (bug should be easier the higher up it is)
  - There should be a "Safe Zone" the where the user has some time to read the code before they immediately splat
  - Have option to submit/speed up or can just wait and hope
  - Maybe in the time it takes to validate that the code has been fixed (when the avatar reaches the bug line) you can show some animation of the avatar either landing nicely or splatting
  - What if at the same time they were trying to fix the code they had to navigate and dodge stuff? that could be an entire game actually, maybe something except bugs and easier to skim
