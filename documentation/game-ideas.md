# The Hoperator

_No order of operations in this game - MAKE SURE TO MAKE NOTE IN BEGINNING_

**Good Ref ( https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators )**

**Will assumme Javascript for the examples below**

key ideas

- a sort of memory game where you assign variables but have to remember what they are and you jump from platform to platform hitting conditionals and solving logic. This could allow us to use a lot more areas of coding
- need to have a language set for each level, otherwise the operators will be confusing.
- **need to make this a balance of aim when it comes to shooting the object + memory + technical knowledge, otherwise without the shooting being hard it will just be extremely unengaging**

scattered ideas:

- use the operators from the link above to force ppl to learn things like right shift assignment (ME >>= 2)
- use comparison operators for means of getting bonuses by taking a risk or easier but mandatory conditionals that will end the level if you dont pass
- one level where you have some obscure variable thats NEVER being used and its a long level and the last jump is a choice between + 1/2 and then a even/odd conditional that kills you if even/odd.
- need to make sure there's a time limit on every jump so people aren't just writing down variables as they play
  - **maybe to avoid ppl writing down every increment of a variable there could be frequent parts of the game where you jump into a "safe zone" and then a series of uncontrolled steps happen quickly that increment certain variables**
- dont need to make every platform code based, can just give some different "abilities"
- later level: only show the prompts of the platforms for x seconds at the beginning
- bit level: all conditionals are bitwise and the numbers are shown in bitwise
- assembly dungeon: assembly code... not sure if this is smart or not
- depending on the language: we could assign functions to variables
- have one variable that is always visible
- need to have enemies/obstacles/bounces/boosts etc. to make it non repetitive

# Space Game

Anti gravitiy style game, you have to write code that handles all the incoming test cases,you're in a space suit or something and you're dodging obstacles in a 2D style.

Then when there are "incoming enemies" you hop in some predetermined glowing area that will trigger a code editor
